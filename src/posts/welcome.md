## The Jeppzone - A health and lifestyle blog

Hi there! A very warm welcome to those of you who have found your way here to my little space on the internet. My name is Jesper Olsson Laine, and I'm a Swedish 30-year-old software developer by profession and a health enthusiast by heart. In this health and lifestyle-focused blog, I will share experiences from my health journey, share my thoughts on different health-related subjects, and to some extent go through what the research says on said subjects. I'm primarily writing this blog as a learning experience and as a way of documenting my health journey, but I also hope that some of you can find inspiration in the subjects that I write about and the experiences that I share. I'll aim to publish at least one post per week.

### Background

To give you some context and background as to why I'm doing this, I have a long history of gut issues, brain fog, feeling lethargic, and a myriad of other issues. I have had these problems for the majority of my life, at least since I was 14 or 15. These issues have been major enough to affect my life negatively, but not severe enough for me to ever really seek help. I kind of thought that feeling like this was the norm. That this is the best that I can ever feel. Fast-forward to 2019. That's when my girlfriend, who was beginning to form an interest in health and lifestyle at the time, bought a course for me about healing the gut. So that's really when my journey towards better health started. I got a bit better after doing the suggested elimination diet in the course and I lost 13 kg in a month, which was absolutely insane. I went from 90 kg to 77 kg, which was absolutely not my intention. I just wanted to focus on my gut health. That's part of why I think that weight loss is a consequence of bettering your health, and not the other way around. Anyway, after the elimination diet, I kind of reverted back to a worse diet and lifestyle because I did not have the real inner drive and interest to better myself that much, and I was not willing to make the "sacrifices" in lifestyle necessary to heal myself for real.

I think my real interest in health and lifestyle started somewhere around the summer of 2021. My girlfriend suggested I listen to Dr. Mark Hyman's podcast [The Doctor's Pharmacy](https://drhyman.com/blog/category/podcasts/) and I never really looked back. From this podcast, I found a myriad of other interesting podcasts and books. I mention some of my favorite resources down below, and I will list relevant resources in every blog post as well. I hope you'll enjoy your stay here and that your interest in health and lifestyle will spark or grow even bigger than it already is!
